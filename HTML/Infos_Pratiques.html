            <p class="app-aProposText">Cannabis, also known as marijuana among other names,is a psychoactive
                 drug from the Cannabis plant used primarily for medical and recreational purposes. 
                 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis, which is one of the 
                 483 known compounds in the plant,including at least 65 other cannabinoids,including cannabidiol (CBD).
                 Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract.

                Cannabis has various mental and physical effects, which include euphoria, altered states of mind and sense of time,
                 difficulty concentrating, impaired short-term memory and body movement, relaxation, and 
                 an increase in appetite.Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, and about 30 to 60 minutes
                  when cooked and eaten. The effects last for two to six hours, depending on the amount used.
